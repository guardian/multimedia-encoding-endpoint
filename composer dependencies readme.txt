This project is now using PHP composer to manage dependencies via the composer.json config.
It's quite simple to install:

 2013  vim composer.json
 2014  curl -s "http://getcomposer.org/installer" | php
 2015  php composer.phar install
 2017  svn add composer.phar 

composer.phar is now in the svn bundle for this
